# meis_game

A small flash card game for my daughter Mei.

## About

Since all the phone apps geared for babies are littered with ad's and/or cost an excessive amount of money, I decided to put together a simple app to let my daughter swipe through flash cards (and possibly photos).

## Status

Currently, I've been working on this project for a few days. This is my first time using dart and flutter so progress is moving a bit slow while I figure out how to use them. Project is still in very early stages and most of the code written so far is temporary (I'm mostly testing things out right now).

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

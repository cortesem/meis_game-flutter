A small flash card game for my daughter Mei.

## About

Since all the phone apps geared for babies are littered with ad's and/or cost an excessive amount of money, I decided to put together a simple app to let my daughter swipe through flash cards (and possibly photos).

## Status

Currently, I've been working on this project for a few days. This is my first time using dart and flutter so progress is moving a bit slow while I figure out how to use them. Project is still in very early stages and most of the code written so far is temporary (I'm mostly testing things out right now).

## How to Use

- If you want to run this app on your device, follow [these](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install "Flutter | Install") installation instructions from the official Flutter website. I suggest using VSCode for simplicity.
- Once installed, download this repo and use your desired tool (command line, ide) to run Flutter apps. A phone or tablet will give best results, but this app will run in the browser or on an emulator.
